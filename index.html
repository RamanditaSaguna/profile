          <h3>Debatting</h3>
          <p>One of my hobbies is debatting or more exactly defending my argument. This debatting hobby is often I used, that's why it becomes one of my skills. The cool thing about my debatting skill is that I don't really feel like I'm good at it, but my friends told me that I'm very good at it and because of that, I think debatting is one of my hobbies that becomes my naturally skills.</p>

          <h3>Technolgy Stuffs</h3>
          <p>I've been playing technologies since I was at elementary school and that's because my dad is an IT. When I was at third grade, I used to have an iPod and sometimes I like to play with it and even I used to jailbreak my own iPod by myself which I think as a third grade kid, that's is something rare and unique, right? Now, I'm a Senior High School student at 51, which that is a public senior high school and you know that sometimes public senior high school is rarely used technologies such as a phone, laptop, and other things and because of that, sometimes they usually ask for my help for something that related to tech things.</p>
